# Advanced-PL-SQL

A project for applying the concepts I've learned in advanced SQL and PL/SQL.

In these two projects, I've applied many concepts in SQL, PL, and SQL.

- The first project is about: 

My task was to create sequences and trigger pairs on all tables in the schema.
using a loop
Drop all sequences first in the loop.
replace any triggers if found. 
Set sequences to start with max id + 1.
for each table.
ignore increment by [only increment by 1]
Do not forget to choose the PK column for each table.
ignore any numbers. primary key or composite keys

- The second project is about: 

My task was to create a table, extract and clean the data from an Excel file, and fill the table with this data. The excel file contains many columns, especially job_title, department_name, and city, that needed special treatment, as each new field of these fields needed to be inserted in its proper table to be able to insert its foreign key in our target table.
